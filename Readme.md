Analyzing data from the New York subway
The New York City Subway offers various data on its complex operation on the internet. After collecting these data, you will use statistics and simple programming to identify patterns, trends and correlations between the information analyzed.

In this Project, you look at NYC Subway Data to find out whether more people ride the subway when it’s raining versus when it’s not.

You will compare New York City Subway data, use statistical methods and data visualization to draw an interesting conclusion about the subway with the dataset that you have analyzed.

This Project will introduce you to the key concepts of Data Science, so you’ll be prepared for future projects in the Data Analyst Nanodegree, as well as your future career as a Data Analyst.

Furthermore, you’ll be exposed to some of the most popular Data Science libraries in Python, such as Pandas, Numpy, and others.

You will be exposed to and learn fundamental Data Science skills, such as:

Dispute Data
Applied Statistics and Machine Learning
MapReduce
